# Countdown Timer

This countdown timer app was built with vanilla javascript, html, css! It counts down from 60 to 0, logs a "time's up!" message to the console, and provides stop / start as well as reset functionality.

## Take it for a spin!

To view the stopwatch timer simply run the index.html file with a live server application like VSCode's LiveServer extension.
